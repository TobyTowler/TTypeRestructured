# About 
- my first large unguided project (technically TType was but this is a continuation)
- very open to any advice
- can use any .txt file where:
    - file is in text directory
    - all text is on the first line of the file
      
## Requirements
- nCurses library
- C++ compiler


# Releases
## v1.2
- Score now shows raw WPM and accurate WPM
- Text files are now stored in "text" directory
- Added start button to title screen

## V1.1
- Added raw words per minute score
  - (total words/time)
  - regardless of accuracy
- Added line wrapping to avoid being cut in half for a new line(most of the time)
- changed title to require a specific key to be pressed to start the game
- Reformatted the score display

## V1.0
- first release
- rebuilt to be object/class based and have better modularity
